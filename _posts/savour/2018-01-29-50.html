            <p class="blog-post-meta">{{ page.date | date_to_string }}</p>
            <p class="my-p my-h">1.React(updated to v16.2.0)：https://reactjs.org/ </p>
            <p class="my-p">Hopefully React can stop to update, cause you have to learn it again and again.But totally I think the thought of conponent UI has been a trend today.So I'm very interesting to learn every new feature in React</p>
            <p class="my-p my-h">2.Redux：https://redux.js.org/ </p>
            <p class="my-p">It's a big mistake to ignore redux in 2015. I have fallen behind. Looks like Redux will replace flux to combine with React and make a better architecture for component.Redux is the top at my list</p>
            <p class="my-p my-h">3.TypeScript：https://www.typescriptlang.org/ and https://www.tslang.cn/index.html</p>
            <p class="my-p">Frankly, I have no idea about TypeScript, just know it's provided by MicroSoft and looks like it can inspect the type of variables. But I think many people have already put it in their project. so I want to know why</p>
            <p class="my-p my-h">4.Webpack/Parcel：https://webpack.js.org/ and https://parceljs.org/</p>
            <p class="my-p">looks like these two autotools have became the most pop tools for front-end autotools.Webpack3 is already done in 2017, and V4 will come later,Parcel appeared in 2017. I will learn it later</p>
            <p class="my-p my-h">5.vue.js: https://cn.vuejs.org/index.html</p>
            <p class="my-p">vue/react/Angular there framework in front-end. I always keep the interest in vue, so hope I have an opportunity to learn and use it in a project</p>
            <p class="my-p my-h">6.others: (keep updating)</p>
            <p class="my-p">ES6/7/8 will be updated obviously. material-ui is the best css/html framework for React.</p>
